1)in order to solve the problem I choose to use a nested list (or list of list) to represent the canvas

2. I then went to create a few function to build the canvas, print to screen, save to txt file and perform the requested tasks

3. the last task the one that requires filling the canvas has a bug and works only in some cases

4. I choose to use parameters in my tests as it is easy to run multiple tests with different input data

5. for some test where I could easily find an expected output I passed also that as input to the test

6. the task can be performed also by running the canvas.py file and it is also useful to isolate one for debugging

7. the interactive menu is build on the function input to gather parameters from terminal by the user

8. I used some dictionaries to be able to create some sort of menu with different "windows" to facilitate the user

I choose to use visual studio as my favourite IDE and before starting working I setup the project folder (I have a repo that I use for that with inside a bash script, check my github for reference)

There are no requirements (as per instructions), only dev requirements

I use pre-commit hooks to automatically format and lynt the code
